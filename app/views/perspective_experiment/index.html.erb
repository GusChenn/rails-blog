      I saw <%= link_to "these pokemon card animations", "https://poke-holo.simey.me/", target: "_blank", class: 'text-pretty body-text font-light underline cursor-pointer decoration-indigo-500 underline-offset-4' %> by Simon Goellner and wanted to try creating something similar but instead of using pokemon cards, I wanted to use some business cards. Yeah, I know, it looks like a boring idea compared to pokemon cards, but I think my business cards ideas are pretty cool as well ðŸ¥¸

    <%= render(UserInterface::Paragraph.new) do %>
      My idea for this page it to use it as an archive for these business cards/ drawings i make!
